# 信号量隔离和线程池隔离

Hystrix使用隔板模式来隔离彼此之间的依赖关系，并限制对其中任何一个的并发访问。

## 线程池隔离

Clients (libraries, network calls, etc) execute on separate threads. This isolates them from the calling thread (Tomcat thread pool) so that the caller may “walk away” from a dependency call that is taking too long.

Hystrix uses separate, **per-dependency thread pools** as a way of constraining any given dependency so latency on the underlying executions will saturate the available threads only in that pool.

Hystrix使用独立的每个依赖线程池来约束任何给定的依赖关系，因此底层执行的延迟将使池中的可用线程饱和。

什么意思呢，就是说你依赖的服务延迟高，仅仅会影响对依赖服务配置的线程池中的线程，不会导致整个Tomcat崩溃。

It is possible for you to protect against failure without the use of thread pools, but this requires the client being trusted to fail very quickly (network connect/read timeouts and retry configuration) and to always behave well.

Netflix, in its design of Hystrix, chose the use of threads and thread-pools to achieve isolation for many reasons including:

1. Many applications execute dozens (and sometimes well over 100) different back-end service calls against dozens of different services developed by as many different teams.
2. Each service provides its own client library.
3. Client libraries are changing all the time.
4. Client library logic can change to add new network calls.
5. Client libraries can contain logic such as retries, data parsing, caching (in-memory or across network), and other such behavior.
6. Client libraries tend to be “black boxes” — opaque to their users about implementation details, network access patterns, configuration defaults, etc.
7. In several real-world production outages the determination was “oh, something changed and properties should be adjusted” or “the client library changed its behavior.”
8. Even if a client itself doesn’t change, the service itself can change, which can then impact performance characteristics which can then cause the client configuration to be invalid.
9. Transitive dependencies can pull in other client libraries that are not expected and perhaps not correctly configured.
10. Most network access is performed synchronously.
11. Failure and latency can occur in the client-side code as well, not just in the network call.

### 线程池隔离有哪些好处呢

1. 应用程序受到完全保护，不受失控客户端库的影响。给定依赖项库的池可以填满，而不会影响应用程序的其余部分。
2. 应用程序可以接受风险低得多的新客户端库。如果出现问题，它将与库隔离，不会影响其他所有内容。
3. 当出现故障的客户端再次恢复正常时，线程池将被清除，应用程序将立即恢复正常性能，而不是在整个Tomcat容器被淹没时进行长时间恢复。
4. 如果客户端库配置错误，线程池的运行状况将很快证明这一点（通过增加错误、延迟、超时、拒绝等），并且您可以在不影响应用程序功能的情况下处理它（通常通过动态属性实时处理）。
5. 如果客户端服务更改了性能特征（这种情况经常发生，可能会成为一个问题），进而导致需要调整属性（增加/减少超时、更改重试次数等），这将再次通过线程池度量（错误、延迟、超时、拒绝）可见，并且可以在不影响其他客户端、请求或用户的情况下进行处理。
6. 除了隔离的好处之外，拥有专用线程池还提供了内置的并发性，可以利用这些并发性在同步客户端库之上构建异步外观（类似于Netflix API在Hystrix命令之上构建反应式、完全异步的Java API）。


简而言之，线程池提供的隔离允许客户端库和子系统性能特征的不断变化和动态组合得到优雅的处理，而不会导致停机。

**尽管单独的线程提供了隔离，但您的底层客户端代码也应该有超时和/或响应线程中断，这样它就不会无限期地阻塞Hystrix线程池并使其饱和。**



### 线程池的缺点


The primary drawback of thread pools is that they add computational overhead. Each command execution involves the queueing, scheduling, and context switching involved in running a command on a separate thread.

Netflix, in designing this system, decided to accept the cost of this overhead in exchange for the benefits it provides and deemed it minor enough to not have major cost or performance impact.

## [Semaphores](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#semaphores)

You can use semaphores (or counters) to limit the number of concurrent calls to any given dependency, instead of using thread pool/queue sizes. This allows Hystrix to shed load without using thread pools but it does not allow for timing out and walking away. If you trust the client and you only want load shedding, you could use this approach.

HystrixCommand and HystrixObservableCommand support semaphores in 2 places:

1. Fallback: When Hystrix retrieves fallbacks it always does so on the calling Tomcat thread.
2. Execution: If you set the property execution.isolation.strategy to SEMAPHORE then Hystrix will use semaphores instead of threads to limit the number of concurrent parent threads that invoke the command.


You can configure both of these uses of semaphores by means of dynamic properties that define how many concurrent threads can execute. You should size them by using similar calculations as you use when sizing a threadpool (an in-memory call that returns in sub-millisecond times can perform well over 5000rps with a semaphore of only 1 or 2 … but the default is 10).

**Note**: if a dependency is isolated with a semaphore and then becomes latent, the parent threads will remain blocked until the underlying network calls timeout.

Semaphore rejection will start once the limit is hit but the threads filling the semaphore can not walk away.
